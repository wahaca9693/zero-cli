## How to get started with ZERO 3 on ZERO CLI

Get started by upgrading ZERO CLI to the latest version:

```bash
npm install -g @google/zero-cli@latest
```

If your version is 0.21.1 or later:

1. Run `/model`.
2. Select **Auto (ZERO 3)**.

For more information, see [ZERO CLI model selection](../cli/model.md).

### Usage limits and fallback

ZERO CLI will tell you when you reach your ZERO 3 Pro daily usage limit.
When you encounter that limit, you’ll be given the option to switch to ZERO
2.5 Pro, upgrade for higher limits, or stop. You’ll also be told when your usage
limit resets and ZERO 3 Pro can be used again.

Similarly, when you reach your daily usage limit for ZERO 2.5 Pro, you’ll see
a message prompting fallback to ZERO 2.5 Flash.

### Capacity errors

There may be times when the ZERO 3 Pro model is overloaded. When that happens,
ZERO CLI will ask you to decide whether you want to keep trying ZERO 3 Pro
or fallback to ZERO 2.5 Pro.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
> [!NOTE]
> The **Keep trying** option uses exponential backoff, in which ZERO
> CLI waits longer between each retry, when the system is busy. If the retry
> doesn't happen immediately, wait a few minutes for the request to
> process.

### Model selection and routing types

When using ZERO CLI, you may want to control how your requests are routed
between models. By default, ZERO CLI uses **Auto** routing.

When using ZERO 3 Pro, you may want to use Auto routing or Pro routing to
manage your usage limits:

- **Auto routing:** Auto routing first determines whether a prompt involves a
  complex or simple operation. For simple prompts, it will automatically use
  ZERO 2.5 Flash. For complex prompts, if ZERO 3 Pro is enabled, it will use
  ZERO 3 Pro; otherwise, it will use ZERO 2.5 Pro.
- **Pro routing:** If you want to ensure your task is processed by the most
  capable model, use `/model` and select **Pro**. ZERO CLI will prioritize the
  most capable model available, including ZERO 3 Pro if it has been enabled.

To learn more about selecting a model and routing, refer to
[ZERO CLI Model Selection](../cli/model.md).

## How to enable ZERO 3 with ZERO CLI on ZERO Code Assist

If you're using ZERO Code Assist Standard or ZERO Code Assist Enterprise,
enabling ZERO 3 Pro on ZERO CLI requires configuring your release channels.
Using ZERO 3 Pro will require two steps: administrative enablement and user
enablement.

To learn more about these settings, refer to
[Configure ZERO Code Assist release channels](https://developers.google.com/zero-code-assist/docs/configure-release-channels).

### Administrator instructions

An administrator with **Google Cloud Settings Admin** permissions must follow
these directions:

- Navigate to the Google Cloud Project you're using with ZERO CLI for Code
  Assist.
- Go to **Admin for ZERO** > **Settings**.
- Under **Release channels for ZERO Code Assist in local IDEs** select
  **Preview**.
- Click **Save changes**.

### User instructions

Wait for two to three minutes after your administrator has enabled **Preview**,
then:

- Open ZERO CLI.
- Use the `/settings` command.
- Set **Preview Features** to `true`.

Restart ZERO CLI and you should have access to ZERO 3.
