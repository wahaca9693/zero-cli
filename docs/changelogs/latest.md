## Highlights

- **Context Manager Simplification:** Completed a significant refactoring of the
  context management system to improve reliability and architectural clarity.
- **A2A Usage Metadata:** Enhanced the Agent-to-Agent protocol to expose usage
  metadata, enabling more transparent resource monitoring.
- **Terminal & PTY Robustness:** Resolved several critical issues related to
  terminal interactions, including Termux relaunch loops and PTY resize errors.
- **Routing Optimizations:** Updated default auto-routing and bypassed
  classifiers for specific tool responses to prevent orphaned function errors.
- **Tool Execution Control:** Forced the `update_topic` tool to execute
  sequentially, ensuring consistent narrative flow in agent interactions.
