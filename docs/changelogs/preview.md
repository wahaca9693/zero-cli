# Preview release: v0.50.0-preview.1

Released: June 25, 2026

Our preview release includes the latest, new, and experimental features. This
release may not be as stable as our [latest weekly release](latest.md).

To install the preview release:

```
npm install -g @google/zero-cli@preview
```

## Highlights

- **GDC Service Identity Support**: Added support for GDC air-gapped Service
  Identity after a major auth library update.
- **Standardised Tool Outputs**: Standardised tool output formatting to ensure
  consistency and readability across different CLI commands.
- **Static Evaluation Analyzer**: Introduced a new static evaluation source
  analyzer to improve development and testing.
- **Vulnerability Prevention**: Hardened CLI security by preventing path
  traversal vulnerabilities during the installation of Skills.
- **Configuration & Error Hardening**: Migrated the `coreTools` configuration
  setting to `tools.core` and ensured zero-quota limits fail fast to prevent
  infinite retry loops.
